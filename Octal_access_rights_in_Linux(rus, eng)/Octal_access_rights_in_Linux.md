### **🛡️ OCTAL PERMISSIONS IN LINUX: THE COMPLETE GUIDE**
*If you find any inaccuracies, please report them in the Issues section.

**IMPORTANT:**

```
Bash: chmod 755 ← without zero
C: chmod(path, 0755) ← with zero!
```

**RULE:** In the C (Programming Language) code, we put `0` before the rights, but not in the terminal.

### **PART 1: BASICS — THE THREE PILLARS OF POWER**

In the Linux world, every file and directory has three key entities that determine its fate:

1.  **Owner (User/`u`):** The one who created the file or was assigned as its owner. The king and god of this file.
2.  **Group (Group/`g`):** A set of users. The file belongs to one group, and everyone in it follows the same rules for this file.
3.  **Others (Others/`o`):** All other users in the system. The anonymous crowd.

For each of these entities, there are three types of actions — **the three pillars of permissions:**

*   **`r` (read) — READ:**
    *   *For a file:* You can open and read the content. Try `cat secret.txt`. If `r` is missing — you'll get `Permission denied`.
    *   *For a directory:* You can get the list of files inside (`ls /some/dir`). Without `r` — `ls` will complain, but that's not the main issue.

*   **`w` (write) — WRITE:**
    *   *For a file:* You can modify the content, overwrite, edit.
    *   *For a directory:* **ATTENTION, NUANCE!** This right allows you to modify the **directory's content** — meaning create, rename, and **delete** files inside. Yes, to delete a file, you need the `w` right **on the directory where it resides**, not on the file itself! This often breaks beginners' minds.

*   **`x` (execute) — EXECUTE:**
    *   *For a file:* The file can be executed as a program or script (`./script.sh`).
    *   *For a directory:* **THE MOST IMPORTANT NUANCE!** This is the right to **ACCESS**. Without `x` on a directory, you cannot enter it (`cd`), you cannot access any file inside, even if you know its exact name and have full rights to it. The directory becomes an impenetrable wall.

**What does this look like in practice?**
Run `ls -l` in the terminal.

```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 2048 Dec 10 15:30 my_script.sh
drwxr-x--- 2 user group 4096 Dec 10 15:31 my_secret_dir/
```

Let's break down the first line:
*   `-` — this is the type (`-` means a regular file, `d` — directory).
*   **`rwx`** — permissions for the **Owner** (read, write, execute).
*   **`r-x`** — permissions for the **Group** (read, execute, CANNOT write).
*   **`r--`** — permissions for **Others** (read only).

---

### **PART 2: THE MAGIC OF THE OCTAL SYSTEM — FROM LETTERS TO NUMBERS**

Symbolic notation is for humans. Octal is for machines and advanced users. It's shorter, more precise, and more powerful.

**The principle is simple: each permission is assigned a weight.**

*   **`r` (read) = 4**
*   **`w` (write) = 2**
*   **`x` (execute) = 1**
*   **`-` (no permission) = 0**

**How are the numbers obtained?** We simply add the weights!

*   Want `rw-`? Calculate: `4` (r) + `2` (w) + `0` (no x) = **6**.
*   Want `r-x`? Calculate: `4` (r) + `0` (no w) + `1` (x) = **5**.
*   Want `---`? Calculate: `0` + `0` + `0` = **0**.
*   Want full power `rwx`? Calculate: `4` + `2` + `1` = **7**.

Now we describe the permissions for Owner, Group, and Others with three digits.

**Real-life examples:**

*   **`755` — Standard for executable files.**
    *   Owner: `7` = `rwx` (full access)
    *   Group: `5` = `r-x` (read and execute)
    *   Others: `5` = `r-x` (read and execute)
    *   `chmod 755 script.sh`

*   **`644` — Standard for data files.**
    *   Owner: `6` = `rw-` (read and write)
    *   Group: `4` = `r--` (read only)
    *   Others: `4` = `r--` (read only)
    *   `chmod 644 document.txt`

*   **`777` — PANDEMONIUM. DEVILISH PERMISSIONS.**
    *   Owner: `7` = `rwx`
    *   Group: `7` = `rwx`
    *   Others: `7` = `rwx`
    *   **ANY** user on the system can do **ANYTHING** with the file. Use only in extreme cases, understanding the consequences. This is a severe security mistake.

---

### **PART 3: UMASK — THE INVISIBLE REGULATOR**

You created a new file: `touch newfile.txt`. What are its permissions? Why not `777` or `666`? Meet — **umask** (user mask).

Umask is a mask that **SUBTRACTS** permissions from the default base values.

*   Base permissions for **files**: `666` (rw-rw-rw-)
*   Base permissions for **directories**: `777` (rwxrwxrwx)

**Standard umask is `022`.**
*   For a file: `666 - 022 = 644` (rw-r--r--). Owner reads-writes, everyone else — reads only.
*   For a directory: `777 - 022 = 755` (rwxr-xr-x). Owner has full access, others — read and enter.

**How to check your umask?** Simply type `umask`.

**How to change it?**
*   For the session: `umask 002` (now files will be `664`, directories `775` — convenient for group work).
*   Permanently: add the command to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.

### **PART 4: SPECIAL BITS — SUPER ABILITIES ⚡**

Remember we talked about three digits? Well, there's also a fourth one, placed at the front. It controls special, almost magical, modes.

*   **`setuid` (Set User ID) — value `4`**
    *   *What does it do?* If this bit is set on an **executable file**, when it's run, the process executes with the permissions of the file's **OWNER**, not the user who launched it.
    *   *Example:* The `passwd` command (`/usr/bin/passwd`). It belongs to `root` and has `setuid`. When you change your password, you temporarily become `root` to write the new hash to the protected file `/etc/shadow`.
    *   *How to set?* `chmod 4755 file` (the first `4` is `setuid`).
    *   *How to see?* In `ls -l`, in place of the owner's `x` there will be `s`: `-rwsr-xr-x`.

*   **`setgid` (Set Group ID) — value `2`**
    *   *For files:* Similar to `setuid`, but the process runs with the file's group permissions.
    *   *FOR DIRECTORIES — SUPER IMPORTANT!* All new files and subdirectories created in a directory with `setgid` will inherit the **group ownership of the parent directory**. Perfect for shared folders!
    *   *How to set?* `chmod 2755 directory/` (the first `2` is `setgid`).
    *   *How to see?* In `ls -l`, in place of the group's `x` there will be `s`: `drwxr-sr-x`.

*   **`sticky bit` — value `1`**
    *   *What does it do?* Mainly used for directories. In a directory with `sticky bit`, a user can only delete or rename files that they own.
    *   *Classic example:* The temporary directory `/tmp`. Everyone can create files, but they can only delete their own.
    *   *How to set?* `chmod 1757 /tmp` (the first `1` is `sticky bit`).
    *   *How to see?* In `ls -l`, in place of the others' `x` there will be `t`: `drwxrwxrwt`.

---

### **PART 5: DEEP NUANCES AND INTRICACIES 🧊**

1.  **Permission Check Priority:** The system checks permissions in order: **Owner -> Group -> Others**. If you are the owner, the group and others permissions are **ignored**. The check stops at the first match.

2.  **Permissions for File Deletion:** To delete a file, you need write permission (**`w`**) **on the directory where the file is located**. The permissions on the file itself are irrelevant for deletion.

3.  **Without `x` on a directory — you are blind:** Even if you have full `rwx` permissions on a file `secret_inside.txt`, but the parent directory lacks execute (`x`) permission, you cannot read that file. You cannot even "reach" it.

4.  **Symbolic Links:** The permissions of the link itself (looks like `lrwxrwxrwx`) don't matter. The permissions of the **target file/directory** are always checked.

5.  **Finding Files with Special Bits (security!):**
    *   Find all `setuid` files: `find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null`
    *   Find all `setgid` files: `find / -perm /2000 2>/dev/null`
    *   Find all `sticky bit` directories: `find / -perm /1000 2>/dev/null`
    *   Check this periodically. Extra `setuid` files are a threat!

6.  **Changing Owner and Group:**
    *   `chown user:group filename` — change owner and group.
    *   `chgrp group filename` — change group only.
    *   Only **root** can do this.

---

### **P.S. FAQ FOR 100 QUESTIONS**

---

### **1. What are octal permissions in Linux?**

*   **Explanation:** This is a numeric (machine) way of representing file and directory access permissions, using the octal number system (base 8). Instead of letters `rwx`, digits from 0 to 7 are used, where each digit is the sum of the weights of three bits: read (4), write (2), and execute (1). It's compact, unambiguous, and clear to the system.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch file.txt
    chmod 755 file.txt
    ls -l file.txt
    ```
    You'll see: `-rwxr-xr-x`. The digits `755` turned into these letters.
*   **Conclusion:** Octal permissions are the system's language for managing permissions. `755` = `rwxr-xr-x`.

---

### **2. How are permissions represented in the octal system?**

*   **Explanation:** With three or four digits.
    *   `ABC` — `A` (owner), `B` (group), `C` (others).
    *   `SABC` — `S` (special bits: setuid, setgid, sticky), `A` (owner), `B` (group), `C` (others).
    The digit `0` means "no permissions", `7` — "all permissions".
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 644 file.txt # Set permissions
    ls -l file.txt     # See: -rw-r--r--
    chmod 4755 file.txt # Add special bit
    ls -l file.txt     # See: -rwsr-xr-x
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Representation is a sequence of digits `[S][U][G][O]`.

---

### **3. What three types of permissions exist for files and directories?**

*   **Explanation:** The same letters, but different meanings:
    *   **`r` (read):** For a file — read the content. For a directory — get the list of files inside (`ls`).
    *   **`w` (write):** For a file — modify the content. For a directory — create, rename, delete files inside it.
    *   **`x` (execute):** For a file — run as a program. For a directory — enter it (`cd`).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    mkdir dir
    chmod 000 dir  # Remove ALL permissions
    ls -l          # See: d--------- ... dir
    cd dir         # Try to enter: bash: cd: dir: Permission denied
    ```
  Conclusion: `rwx` permissions for files and directories are about DIFFERENT actions.
      ---

### **4. What number corresponds to read (r) permission?**

*   **Explanation:** The weight of `r` permission is **4**. This is the high bit in the three-bit sequence. In binary `100`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 400 file.txt # Give ONLY read to owner
    ls -l file.txt     # See: -r--------
    cat file.txt       # Will work (if there's something to read)
    echo "test" > file.txt # Will NOT work: Permission denied
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `r` = `4`. This is the foundation.

---

### **5. What number corresponds to write (w) permission?**

*   **Explanation:** The weight of `w` permission is **2**. This is the middle bit. In binary `010`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 200 file.txt # Give ONLY write to owner
    ls -l file.txt     # See: --w-------
    echo "test" > file.txt # Will work! File will be overwritten.
    cat file.txt       # Will NOT work: Permission denied
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `w` = `2`. Control over modification.

---

### **6. What number corresponds to execute (x) permission?**

*   **Explanation:** The weight of `x` permission is **1**. This is the low bit. In binary `001`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 100 file.txt # Give ONLY execute to owner
    ls -l file.txt     # See: ---x------
    cat file.txt       # Will NOT work: Permission denied
    # But if this was a script, it could be run.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `x` = `1`. The key to execution and entry.

---

### **7. How are values added for permission combinations?**

*   **Explanation:** Simple arithmetic. Need read and write? `4 (r) + 2 (w) = 6`. Need read and execute? `4 (r) + 1 (x) = 5`. All permissions? `4+2+1=7`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 754 file.txt
    ls -l file.txt # Decode:
                   # 7 = 4+2+1 = rwx (owner)
                   # 5 = 4+0+1 = r-x (group)
                   # 4 = 4+0+0 = r-- (others)
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Adding weights is the magic of octal permissions.

---

### **8. What does the first digit mean in a four-digit octal notation?**

 **STEP 1: REMEMBER THE BASICS**
Regular permissions are three digits: `755`, `644`, etc.
- **First digit** → **owner** permissions
- **Second digit** → **group** permissions
- **Third digit** → **others** permissions

 **STEP 2: THE FOURTH DIGIT IS AN ADDITIONAL LEVEL**
When you see FOUR digits (`2755`, `4755`, `1755`), a different logic applies here:

- **`2`755** - **FIRST** digit (`2`)
- **`4`755** - **FIRST** digit (`4`)
- **`1`755** - **FIRST** digit (`1`)

**This first digit controls NOT access permissions, but SPECIAL MODES!**

 **STEP 3: WHAT ARE THESE MODES?**
The first digit is the sum of three special flags:

| Mode | Value | What it does |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **setuid** | `4` | File runs with owner's privileges |
| **setgid** | `2` | File runs with group's privileges OR files in directory inherit group |
| **sticky bit** | `1` | In directory, users can only delete their OWN files |

 **STEP 4: HOW IT WORKS IN PRACTICE**

```bash
# Regular permissions (three digits)
chmod 755 file.txt    # → -rwxr-xr-x

# Special modes (four digits)
chmod 4755 file.txt   # → -rwsr-xr-x (appeared 's' - this is setuid)
chmod 2755 file.txt   # → -rwxr-sr-x (appeared 's' in group - this is setgid)
chmod 1755 dir/       # → drwxr-xr-t (appeared 't' - this is sticky bit)
```

 **STEP 5: SIMPLE ANALOGY**
Imagine you have a car:
- **Permissions 755** = who can drive (owner, group, others)
- **First digit 4** = special mode "drive as racer" (setuid)
- **First digit 2** = special mode "drive as taxi driver" (setgid)
- **First digit 1** = special mode "parking for own only" (sticky bit)

 **STEP 6: WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**
- **Without first digit** (or with `0`) — only regular permissions work
- **With first digit** — "superpowers" for files/directories are enabled

 **PRACTICE FOR REINFORCEMENT:**
```bash
# Create a file
touch test.txt

# Set regular permissions
chmod 755 test.txt
ls -l test.txt    # → -rwxr-xr-x

# Add setuid (first digit 4)
chmod 4755 test.txt
ls -l test.txt    # → -rwsr-xr-x (see 's' instead of 'x' for owner?)

# Remove special modes
chmod 0755 test.txt
ls -l test.txt    # → -rwxr-xr-x (back to regular permissions)
```
CONCLUSION: The first digit in four-digit notation is an **additional "operating mode"** for a file or directory that provides special capabilities not directly related to reading/writing/executing.

---

### **9. What additional bits exist besides the basic ones (setuid, setgid, sticky bit)?**

*   **Explanation:** We need to differentiate:

    1.  **Basic special permission bits** (classic, within the `rwx` model):
        *   **`setuid` (SUID)** — changes the effective user to the file owner upon execution.
        *   **`setgid` (SGID)** — for files, changes the effective group; for directories, forces new files to inherit the directory's group.
        *   **`sticky bit** — in directories, prevents deletion of files by non-owners.

        ⚠️ **These three bits are ALL that can be controlled via the *first digit* in octal notation (`4`, `2`, `1`).**

    2.  **File system extended attributes**, which are **NOT part of the octal permissions model** and are managed by other commands (`setfattr`, `getfattr`). Examples:
        *   `a` (append-only) — file can only be opened for appending.
        *   `i` (immutable) — file cannot be modified, renamed, or deleted (even by root!).
        *   Used for additional security and metadata.

    3.  **Access Control Lists (ACL)**, which **extend** the basic permission model, allowing setting permissions for specific users and groups. They are also not part of the classic octal bits.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # 1. Working with classic bits (via chmod)
    chmod 4755 /usr/bin/special_program # Setting setuid
    ls -l /usr/bin/special_program      # Check: -rwsr-xr-x

    # 2. Working with extended attributes (THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT PERMISSIONS)
    sudo touch /root/immutable_file.txt
    sudo chattr +i /root/immutable_file.txt # Set "immutable" attribute
    sudo rm /root/immutable_file.txt        # Error: Operation not permitted

    # 3. Working with ACL (THIS IS ALSO NOT JUST ABOUT PERMISSIONS)
    touch shared_file.txt
    setfacl -m u:username:rwx shared_file.txt # Give permissions to specific user
    getfacl shared_file.txt                 # View extended permissions
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** In the context of **octal permissions** (`chmod 755`), "additional bits" refers to **ONLY `setuid`, `setgid`, and `sticky bit`**. Extended attributes and ACL are mechanisms at a different level, not managed via octal `chmod` notation.
---

### **10. What octal value corresponds to setuid?**

*   **Explanation:** `setuid` corresponds to the value **4** in the high (special) digit.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 4755 file.txt
    ls -l file.txt # See: -rwsr-xr-x ( 's' in place of owner's 'x')
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `setuid` = `4` in the fourth digit.

---

### **11. What octal value corresponds to setgid?**

*   **Explanation:** `setgid` corresponds to the value **2** in the high digit.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 2755 file.txt
    ls -l file.txt # See: -rwxr-sr-x ( 's' in place of group's 'x')
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `setgid` = `2` in the fourth digit.

---

### **12. What octal value corresponds to sticky bit?**

*   **Explanation:** `sticky bit` corresponds to the value **1** in the high digit.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 1755 dir/ # Set on directory
    ls -ld dir/     # See: drwxr-xr-t ( 't' in place of others' 'x')
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `sticky bit` = `1` in the fourth digit.

---

### **13. How are permissions displayed in symbolic notation (ls -l)?**

*   **Explanation:** The first 10 characters.
    *   1st: file type (`-` file, `d` directory, `l` link).
    *   2nd-4th: owner permissions (`rwx`).
    *   5th-7th: group permissions (`r-x`).
    *   8th-10th: others permissions (`r--`).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -l /bin/bash
    # Example output: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1237744 ... /bin/bash
    # Breakdown:
    # - this is a file
    # rwx root (owner) can do everything
    # r-x group root can read and execute
    # r-x all others can read and execute
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `ls -l` shows permissions in a human-readable letter format.

---

### **14. How to interpret the output of ls -l for a file?**

*   **Explanation:** Look at the first 10 characters and the "owner" and "group" columns.
    Example: `-rwxr-xr-- 1 user project 1024 file`
    *   `-`: file.
    *   `rwx`: owner `user` can read, write, execute.
    *   `r-x`: group `project` can read and execute.
    *   `r--`: all others can only read.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch testfile
    chmod 754 testfile
    ls -l testfile # Compare with the breakdown above.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Interpretation is translating `rwx` characters into permissions for user/group/other.

---

### **15. How to interpret the output of ls -l for a directory?**

*   **Explanation:** Similar to a file, but remember the different meaning of `rwx` for directories.
    Example: `drwxr-x--- 2 admin devs 4096 my_dir`
    *   `d`: directory.
    *   `rwx`: owner `admin` can `ls`, `cd`, create/delete files.
    *   `r-x`: group `devs` can `ls`, `cd`, but cannot create/delete.
    *   `---`: all others have no access at all.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    mkdir testdir
    chmod 750 testdir
    ls -ld testdir # 'd' option for directories
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** For directories `r`=list, `w`=modify content, `x`=enter.

---

### **16. How to change permissions using the chmod command and octal numbers?**

*   **Explanation:** Syntax: `chmod <numbers> <filename>`. Numbers are the octal permission code.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch file1.txt
    ls -l file1.txt # Initial permissions (likely 644)
    chmod 755 file1.txt
    ls -l file1.txt # New permissions: rwxr-xr-x
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod <numbers>` is the most direct way to set permissions.

---

### **17. How to set 755 permissions on a file using chmod?**

*   **Explanation:** `chmod 755 filename`. This gives: owner=`rwx` (7), group=`r-x` (5), others=`r-x` (5).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch my_script
    chmod 755 my_script
    ls -l my_script # Should be: -rwxr-xr-x
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `755` — classic for executable scripts and programs.

---

### **18. How to set 644 permissions on a file using chmod?**

*   **Explanation:** `chmod 644 filename`. This gives: owner=`rw-` (6), group=`r--` (4), others=`r--` (4).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch data.txt
    chmod 644 data.txt
    ls -l data.txt # Should be: -rw-r--r--
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `644` — classic for data, configs, images.

---

### **19. What do 755 permissions mean for a file?**

*   **Explanation:** Owner can do everything (read, modify, execute). Group and all others can read and execute the file, but cannot modify it. Ideal for programs that many should have access to, but only the author can change.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    echo 'echo "Hello World"' > script.sh
    chmod 755 script.sh
    ./script.sh # Will work for any user
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `755` = full control for owner, read+execute for all.

---

### **20. What do 644 permissions mean for a file?**

*   **Explanation:** Owner can read and modify. Group and all others can only read. Standard for most data files.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    echo "Secret data" > info.txt
    chmod 644 info.txt
    cat info.txt # Will work for all
    echo "hack" >> info.txt # Successful only for owner, for others - Permission denied.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `644` = read and write for owner, read — for all.

---
 ### **21. What do 777 permissions mean for a file?**

*   **Explanation:** **CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE!** Permissions `777` (rwxrwxrwx) mean that **ABSOLUTELY ANY** process or user on the system (including random, unauthorized, and malicious ones) gets complete and total control over the file. This includes reading, modification, deletion, and if the file is executable — execution on your behalf. Setting such permissions is a direct violation of the principle of least privilege and an act of vandalism against system security.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch critical_file.txt
    echo "Top Secret Data" > critical_file.txt
    chmod 777 critical_file.txt  # CATEGORICALLY UNACCEPTABLE!
    ls -l critical_file.txt

    # Now ANY user can:
    # cat critical_file.txt      # Data leak
    # echo "HACKED" > critical_file.txt # Data corruption
    # rm critical_file.txt       # Complete destruction

    # IMMEDIATELY FIX:
    chmod 600 critical_file.txt  # or 644, if others need read
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `777` = "I surrender and hand over the keys to my system to hackers". **NEVER DO THIS.**
---

### **22. What do 750 permissions mean for a file?**

*   **Explanation:** Owner: `rwx` (7). Group: `r-x` (5). Others: `---` (0). Owner does everything, group members read and execute, all others — banned.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 750 script.sh
    ls -l script.sh # -rwxr-x---
    # A user not in the group won't even be able to read the file.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `750` = secure access for owner and group, ban for others.

---

### **23. What do 700 permissions mean for a file?**

*   **Explanation:** Owner: `rwx` (7). Group: `---` (0). Others: `---` (0). Only the owner has full access. Maximum privacy.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    echo "my secret" > private.txt
    chmod 700 private.txt
    ls -l private.txt # -rwx------
    # No one but you can even know the file size.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `700` = "mine, and no one touches it".

---

### **24. What default permissions are set for new files?**

*   **Explanation:** Depends on `umask`. Without umask it would be `666` for files and `777` for directories. But the standard umask `022` subtracts permissions for group and others, resulting in `644` and `755`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    umask          # Check current umask (e.g., 0022)
    touch new_file
    mkdir new_dir
    ls -ld new_file new_dir
    # new_file: -rw-r--r-- (644)
    # new_dir: drwxr-xr-x (755)
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** By default files `644`, directories `755` (with umask 022).

---

### **25. How do umask settings affect created files and directories?**

*   **Explanation:** Umask is a mask that "takes away" permissions. It is subtracted from the maximum permissions.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    umask 077      # Take away all permissions from group and others
    touch ultra_private_file
    mkdir ultra_private_dir
    ls -ld ultra_private_*
    # ultra_private_file: -rw------- (600)
    # ultra_private_dir: drwx------ (700)
    umask 022      # PUT IT BACK to avoid breaking your system!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Umask determines which permissions to **block** by default.

---

### **26. How to calculate final file permissions considering umask?**

*   **Explanation:** The umask operation mechanism is bitwise masking, not arithmetic subtraction. Formula: **Final permissions = Base permissions BITWISE AND (NOT umask)**. Base permissions: files — `666` (rw-rw-rw-), directories — `777` (rwxrwxrwx). The `& ~umask` operation "turns off" the bits specified in umask.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    umask 027
    touch file1.txt
    mkdir dir1
    ls -ld file1.txt dir1
    # See result: file1.txt = 640 (rw-r-----), dir1 = 750 (rwxr-x---)

    # CALCULATION FOR UMAASK 027:
    # File:   666 & ~027 = 110110110 & 111110000 = 110110000 = 640
    # Directory: 777 & ~027 = 111111111 & 111110000 = 111110000 = 750

    # Compare with "subtraction":
    # 666 - 027 = 639 -> INCORRECT! Correct is 640.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Umask is a bitmask of denials. Use the `Base & ~umask` operation for precise calculation.
---

### **27. How does umask work in octal representation?**

*   **Explanation:** Umask is an octal number. Each digit corresponds to a category (owner, group, others) and shows which permissions to take away.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    umask 0022 # This is the same as 022
    umask      # May show as 0022 or 022
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Umask in octal form is a mask of denials.

---
### **28. How to set umask for a session?**

*   **Explanation:** The `umask <value>` command changes the default permission mask for the current shell session. **SECURITY WARNING:** Value `000` or `0022` creates files with permissions `666` (rw-rw-rw-) and `777` (rwxrwxrwx) respectively, which can lead to data leaks. Recommended values: `022` (files 644, directories 755) for isolation, `027` (files 640, directories 750) for strict security, `002` (files 664, directories 775) for group collaboration.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    umask 000      # DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT! Creates open files
    touch open_file.txt
    ls -l open_file.txt # -rw-rw-rw- VULNERABLE!

    umask 027      # CORRECT CHOICE FOR SERVER
    touch secure_file.txt
    mkdir secure_dir
    ls -ld secure_file.txt secure_dir
    # secure_file.txt: -rw-r----- (640)
    # secure_dir: drwxr-x--- (750)

    umask 022      # Return to standard value
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Set umask consciously. `umask 027` is a safe default choice.

---

### **29. How to make umask permanent for a user?**

*   **Explanation:** You need to add the `umask <value>` command to the user's shell initialization file. Usually this is `~/.bashrc` for bash or `~/.profile`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    echo "umask 002" >> ~/.bashrc # Add line to end of file
    source ~/.bashrc              # Reload settings
    umask                         # Check: should be 0002
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** To make umask permanent, add it to `~/.bashrc`.

---

### **30. What is the difference in applying permissions to files versus directories?**

*   **Explanation:** This is the most critical nuance!
    *   **File:** Permissions apply to the file itself.
    *   **Directory:** Permissions apply to the *entries in the directory* (the list of files). The `w` permission on a directory allows deleting files inside, even if you don't have permissions on the file itself!

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    mkdir test_dir
    touch test_dir/protected_file
    chmod 000 test_dir/protected_file # Deny everything for the file

    # Demonstration: having write permission on the directory, you can delete the file
    # WARNING: this is a vulnerability demonstration!
    chmod 700 test_dir  # Give full permissions on the directory to owner

    # Check that the file is protected:
    cat test_dir/protected_file  # Permission denied - file access denied

    # But the file CAN be deleted:
    rm test_dir/protected_file   # Will work! 'w' on directory allows deletion

    # Restore file and set safe permissions:
    touch test_dir/protected_file
    chmod 755 test_dir  # Safe directory permissions
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Directory permissions control operations with filenames inside, not with their content. `w` on directory = ability to manage files inside, regardless of their individual permissions.
---

### **31. What does execute (x) permission do for a directory?**

*   **Explanation:** This is the **access** permission. Without `x` on a directory you cannot make it your current directory (`cd`), you cannot access any file inside, even if you know its exact name and have full permissions to it.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    mkdir mydir
    touch mydir/secret.txt
    chmod 100 mydir # Give only ENTRY (x) permission to owner
    cd mydir        # Will work! We are inside.
    ls              # Will NOT work: Permission denied (no 'r')
    cat secret.txt  # Will work! We have access to the file, knowing its name.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `x` on directory = key to the door. Without the key, you can't get inside.

---

### **32. What does read (r) permission do for a directory?**

*   **Explanation:** Gives the ability to read the list of files in the directory (`ls` command). But useless without execute (`x`) permission.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 500 mydir # Give 'r-x' to owner (5 = 4+1)
    cd mydir
    ls              # Now it works! We see the file list.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `r` on directory = ability to see what's behind the door. But you also need the key (`x`).

---

### **33. What does write (w) permission do for a directory?**

*   **Explanation:** Gives the ability to modify the directory's content: create, rename, and **delete** files inside. To delete a file, `w` permission is needed on the directory, not on the file itself!
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 300 mydir # Give '-wx' to owner (3 = 2+1)
    cd mydir
    ls              # Won't work (no 'r')
    touch newfile   # Will work! (has 'w')
    rm secret.txt   # Will work! (has 'w')
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `w` on directory = right to rearrange furniture in the room (files in the directory).

---

### **34. How do permission combinations affect a directory?**

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `--x` (1): Access to files by name, but cannot view the list.
    *   `-w-` (2): Useless without `x` (cannot enter to create something).
    *   `-wx` (3): Can enter and create/delete files, but cannot view the list. Strange, but sometimes useful for "black boxes".
    *   `r--` (4): Useless. Can try to read the list, but without `x` the system won't allow it.
    *   `r-x` (5): Standard access. Read list and enter.
    *   `rwx` (7): Full control.
*   **Practice:** Experiment with `chmod` on a directory, setting values from 0 to 7 and trying `ls`, `cd`, `touch`, `rm`.
*   **Conclusion:** Effective combinations for directories: `0`, `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`.

---

### **35. What happens if a directory lacks execute permission?**

*   **Explanation:** The directory becomes impassable. Access to any files inside, even via direct path, is blocked.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 600 mydir # 'rw-' for owner
    cat mydir/secret.txt # Permission denied, even if the file has 777 permissions!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** No `x` on directory = wall. Files inside are unreachable.

---
### **36. How is directory execute permission related to accessing files inside?**

*   **Explanation:** Execute (`x`) permission on a directory is the **permission to traverse** the file path. To access a file via the path `/home/user/dir/file.txt`, the system must "pass through" every directory in this path. For this, the user must have `x` permission on **each** parent directory: `/`, `/home`, `/home/user`, and `/home/user/dir`. Without `x` permission on any of these directories, access to the file is blocked, even if the file itself has `777` permissions.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Create a deep directory structure
    mkdir -p level1/level2/level3
    echo "secret data" > level1/level2/level3/file.txt

    # Give full permissions to the file itself
    chmod 777 level1/level2/level3/file.txt

    # Block access to level2
    chmod 000 level1/level2

    # Try to access the file
    cat level1/level2/level3/file.txt
    # Result: cat: level1/level2/level3/file.txt: Permission denied

    # Try to list contents of level1 (it has r-x)
    ls -la level1/
    # We'll see level2, but won't be able to enter it

    # Restore permissions for level2
    chmod 755 level1/level2
    cat level1/level2/level3/file.txt # Now it works!
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** `x` permission on a directory is the **key for passage** through that directory on the path to a file. Without the key on any door, the path becomes impassable.
---

### **37. How does setuid affect executable files?**

*   **Explanation:** When a file with the `setuid` bit set is run, the process executes with the effective UID (eUID) of the file's **owner**, not the real user who launched it. This allows regular users to perform tasks requiring elevated privileges. **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** In modern Linux systems, the kernel **ignores** the `setuid` bit on interpreted scripts (bash, Python, Perl, etc.) due to fundamental security vulnerabilities. This mechanism works **only for binary executable files**.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # EXAMPLE 1: Binary file (setuid WORKS)
    ls -l /usr/bin/passwd # -rwsr-xr-x ... setuid works, allows updating /etc/shadow

    # EXAMPLE 2: Shell script (setuid DOESN'T WORK - DON'T DO THIS!)
    echo 'echo "I am user: $(whoami)"' > test_script.sh
    sudo chown root:root test_script.sh
    sudo chmod 4755 test_script.sh # Try to set setuid
    ls -l test_script.sh # Will show -rwsr-xr-x, but...
    ./test_script.sh # Will output your regular username, NOT root!

    # CORRECT WAY for scripts:
    # Configure sudo via visudo for the specific script
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `setuid` gives the power of the file owner, but **only for compiled programs**. For scripts, use `sudo`.

---

### **38. When is setuid used?**

*   **Explanation:** For system utilities that need elevated privileges to perform their task but should be available to regular users.
    *   Classics: `passwd`, `sudo`, `mount`, `ping`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -l /usr/bin/passwd /usr/bin/sudo /bin/ping
    # You'll see 's' in the owner permissions. They all belong to root.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `setuid` is used for controlled privilege escalation.

---

### **39. How does setgid affect executable files?**

*   **Explanation:** Similar to `setuid`, but the process runs with the permissions of the file's **group**, not the user's group.
*   **Practice:** (Less common)
    ```bash
    sudo chgrp specialgroup script.sh
    sudo chmod 2755 script.sh
    ls -l script.sh # -rwxr-sr-x ... 's' in group
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `setgid` for files = power of the file's group upon execution.

---


### **40. How does setgid affect directories?**

*   **Explanation:** When `setgid` is set on a directory, all **NEWLY CREATED** files and subdirectories inside it automatically inherit the group ownership of the parent directory, not the primary group of the user who created them. **IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:** This only affects the creation process. Existing files do not automatically change their group when `setgid` is set. For them, you need to use `chgrp` manually or `find` for bulk changes.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /project_alpha
    sudo chgrp dev_team /project_alpha
    sudo chmod 2775 /project_alpha  # setgid + rwx for owner and group
    ls -ld /project_alpha          # drwxrwsr-x ... see 's' in group

    # Test group inheritance:
    touch /project_alpha/new_file.txt
    mkdir /project_alpha/new_subdir
    ls -ld /project_alpha/new_file.txt /project_alpha/new_subdir
    # BOTH objects will have group 'dev_team'!

    # Check on existing files:
    touch existing_file.txt
    mv existing_file.txt /project_alpha/
    ls -l /project_alpha/existing_file.txt
    # Group remained the same! setgid is not applied retroactively.

    # Bulk fix for existing files:
    find /project_alpha -type f -exec chgrp dev_team {} \;
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `setgid` on directory = forced group inheritance for new objects. Existing files need to be fixed separately.

---

### **41. What does sticky bit do on a directory?**

*   **Explanation:** In a directory with `sticky bit`, a user can only delete or rename files that they own. Even if they have `w` permission on the entire directory.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -ld /tmp # Classic example: drwxrwxrwt
    # Try creating a file in /tmp and ask another user to delete it. They won't succeed!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `sticky bit` = "delete only your own".

---

### **42. Where is sticky bit typically used?**

*   **Explanation:** In shared directories where many users have write permission.
    *   `/tmp` — temporary files of all users.
    *   `/var/tmp` — similarly.
    *   Sometimes in `~/.cache` or other cache directories.
*   **Practice:** Look at system directories:
    ```bash
    ls -ld /tmp /var/tmp
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `sticky bit` — for publicly accessible directories with vandalism protection.

---

### **43. How to see set special bits in ls -l?**

*   **Explanation:** They appear as `s` or `t` in place of the `x` letter in the respective categories.
    *   `setuid`: `s` instead of `x` for owner.
    *   `setgid`: `s` instead of `x` for group.
    *   `sticky bit`: `t` instead of `x` for others.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -l /usr/bin/passwd  # See -rwsr-xr-x (setuid)
    ls -ld /tmp            # See drwxrwxrwt (sticky bit)
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Look for `s` and `t` in `ls -l` output.

---

### **44. How to distinguish setuid in ls -l output?**

*   **Explanation:** The letter `s` (lowercase) in the **three owner permission characters**. If the owner had execute permission, then `s` is lowercase. If not, then `S` uppercase (a rare and strange case).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
    # ... -rwsr-xr-x ... <- this 's' in the first group.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `s` in owner permissions = `setuid`.

---

### **45. How to distinguish setgid in ls -l output?**

*   **Explanation:** The letter `s` in the **three group permission characters**.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -ld /shared # from example above
    # ... drwxr-sr-x ... <- 's' in the second group.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `s` in group permissions = `setgid`.

---

### **46. How to distinguish sticky bit in ls -l output?**

*   **Explanation:** The letter `t` in the **three others permission characters**.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -ld /tmp
    # ... drwxrwxrwt ... <- 't' in the third group.
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `t` in others permissions = `sticky bit`.

---

### **47. How to set setuid using chmod and the octal system?**

*   **Explanation:** Add `4` as the first digit. Example: `chmod 4755 file`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 4755 my_program
    ls -l my_program # Should show 's': -rwsr-xr-x
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod 4xxx` sets `setuid`.

---

### **48. How to set setgid using chmod and the octal system?**

*   **Explanation:** Add `2` as the first digit. Example: `chmod 2755 file_or_dir`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 2755 my_dir
    ls -ld my_dir # Should show 's' in group: drwxr-sr-x
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod 2xxx` sets `setgid`.

---

### **49. How to set sticky bit using chmod and the octal system?**

*   **Explanation:** Add `1` as the first digit. Example: `chmod 1755 dir`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 1755 my_shared_dir
    ls -ld my_shared_dir # Should show 't': drwxr-xr-t
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod 1xxx` sets `sticky bit`.

---

### **50. How to remove special bits using chmod?**

*   **Explanation:** Set the first digit to `0`. Example: `chmod 0755 file`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 0755 my_program # Remove setuid
    ls -l my_program      # 's' disappeared, now -rwxr-xr-x
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod 0xxx` resets all special bits.
---

### **51. What security risks are associated with setuid?**

*   **Explanation:** setuid is a mega-weapon. If a setuid program has a vulnerability (buffer overflow, injection), an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the file owner's privileges (often root). This is a complete system compromise.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Find all setuid files (can be dangerous!)
    find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null | head -10
    # See which ones belong to root
    find / -type f -user root -perm /4000 2>/dev/null | head -5
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** setuid = nuclear button. One code error — and the system is hacked.

---

### **52. Why is it unsafe to set setuid on all files?**

*   **Explanation:** Violates the principle of least privilege. Every setuid program expands the system's attack surface. If an attacker finds a vulnerability in any of these programs, they can execute code with the file owner's privileges (often root), leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Analyze existing setuid programs (without modification!)
    find /usr/bin -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null | head -5
    # See only verified system utilities

    # Imagine the danger of setting setuid on regular commands:
    # If /bin/cat had setuid root, any user could read
    # system files like /etc/shadow via: cat /etc/shadow
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** setuid should be applied precisely only to verified system utilities. Setting it on arbitrary files creates critical security threats.


---

### **53. How to find all setuid files in the system?**

*   **Explanation:** Use find with permission check `-perm /4000`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Main command
    find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

    # Safer option - save to file
    find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null > setuid_files.txt
    wc -l setuid_files.txt  # Count the number
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `find / -perm /4000` — your security scanner.

---

### **54. How to find all setgid files in the system?**

*   **Explanation:** Similarly, but mask `2000`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    find / -type f -perm /2000 2>/dev/null

    # Both setuid and setgid together
    find / -type f -perm /6000 2>/dev/null
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `find / -perm /2000` for setgid files.

---

### **55. How to find all files with sticky bit in the system?**

*   **Explanation:** Mask `1000`, but usually sticky bit is used only for directories.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Directories with sticky bit
    find / -type d -perm /1000 2>/dev/null

    # All files with sticky bit (rarity)
    find / -type f -perm /1000 2>/dev/null
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** sticky bit mainly for directories like `/tmp`.

---

### **56. How do permissions change when copying a file?**

*   **Explanation:** When copying, a completely new file is created. Standard file creation rules apply to this new file: base permissions (666 for regular files, 777 for directories) are modified by the user's current umask. The source file's permissions are NOT preserved unless special options are used.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Create source file with non-standard permissions
    touch source.txt
    chmod 751 source.txt  # Set specific permissions
    ls -l source.txt      # Check: -rwxr-x--x

    # Copy file normally
    cp source.txt copy_default.txt
    ls -l copy_default.txt
    # Permissions will be: -rw-r--r-- (644), if umask = 0022
    # This is 666 (base) & ~022 (umask) = 644

    # Copy with preserved attributes
    cp -p source.txt copy_preserved.txt
    ls -l copy_preserved.txt
    # Permissions will be: -rwxr-x--x (751) - same as source file

    # Check current umask
    umask
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** With normal copying, permissions are reset to default values considering umask. Use `cp -p` to preserve source file permissions.

---

### **57. How do permissions change when moving a file?**

*   **Explanation:** When moving within the same filesystem, the file is not recreated — all metadata is preserved (permissions, owner, timestamps).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch original.txt
    chmod 751 original.txt
    chown nobody original.txt  # if you have permissions
    mv original.txt moved.txt
    ls -l moved.txt  # All permissions and owner preserved!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Moving = same metadata.

### **58. Are special bits preserved when copying?**

*   **Explanation:** Usually NO. Commands like `cp` reset special bits by default.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 4755 script.sh
    cp script.sh copy.sh
    ls -l script.sh copy.sh
    # copy.sh will be without setuid!

    # Preserve special bits
    cp -p script.sh copy_preserved.sh  # -p preserves attributes
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** By default, they are reset. Use `cp -p` to preserve.

---

### **59. Does the file owner affect permission application?**

*   **Explanation:** CRITICALLY! The system first checks: "Are you the owner?" If YES — owner permissions are applied. Other checks are skipped.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch file.txt
    chmod 700 file.txt  # Only owner has access
    # Other users won't even be able to read the file
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Owner = king and god of their file.

---

### **60. Does the file group affect permission application?**

*   **Explanation:** Yes, but only if the user is not the owner. Check: "Owner? → No → In group? → Yes → Group permissions".
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 750 file.txt
    # Owner: rwx
    # Group: r-x
    # Others: ---
    # A user from the group can read and execute, but not write
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Group = second level of access after owner.

---

### **61. What is the order of permission checking (user, group, other)?**

*   **Explanation:** Strict waterfall: **User → Group → Other**. Check stops at the first match.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # User is both owner and in the group
    # But system will only check "owner?" and apply user permissions
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Priority: User > Group > Other.

---

### **62. What has priority in permission checking - user permissions or group permissions?**

*   **Explanation:** User (owner) permissions. If you are the owner — group permissions are ignored.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 744 file.txt  # user: rwx, group: r--, other: r--
    # Owner has full access, despite limited group permissions
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Owner is always more important than group.

---

### **63. What happens if the user is the file owner?**

*   **Explanation:** ONLY permissions from the "user" field are applied. Group and other are not checked.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 704 file.txt  # user: rwx, group: ---, other: r--
    # Owner can do everything, even though group has no permissions at all
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Owner = only user permissions are applied.

---

### **64. What happens if the user is in the file's group?**

*   **Explanation:** If the user is NOT the owner, but is in the group — group permissions are applied.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 750 file.txt
    # User from group: can read and execute (r-x)
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Group member = group permissions are applied.

---

### **65. What happens if the user is not the owner and not in the file's group?**

*   **Explanation:** "other" permissions are applied.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 751 file.txt  # other: --x
    # An outside user can only execute the file
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Stranger = other permissions are applied.

---

### **66. How to change file owner?**

*   **Explanation:** `chown` command.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    sudo chown newuser file.txt
    sudo chown newuser:newgroup file.txt
    sudo chown :newgroup file.txt  # group only
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chown` to change owner/group.

---

### **67. How to change file group?**

*   **Explanation:** `chgrp` or `chown :group`.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chgrp developers file.txt
    # or
    chown :developers file.txt
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chgrp` or `chown :group` to change group.

---

### **68. What permissions are needed to change file owner?**

*   **Explanation:** Only the superuser (root) can change a file's owner.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chown otheruser file.txt  # Permission denied
    sudo chown otheruser file.txt  # Will work
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Only root can change owner.

---
### **69. What permissions are needed to change file group?**

*   **Explanation:** In standard Linux configuration:
    - **Superuser (root):** Can change the file's group to **any** existing group in the system.
    - **Regular user:** **CANNOT** change the file's group using `chgrp` or `chown :group`. This requires the **`CAP_CHOWN`** privilege, which only root possesses by default.

    *Clarification:* Some specially configured systems may have exceptions, but in standard setup, changing group is root's privilege.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Try to change group as regular user
    touch myfile.txt
    groups  # Check groups we belong to
    chgrp $(id -gn) myfile.txt  # Permission denied in standard system

    # Only root can change group
    sudo chgrp www-data myfile.txt  # Will work
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** In standard Linux, changing file group is an exclusive superuser privilege.
---

### **70. Can a regular user change file owner?**

*   **Explanation:** NO. Under no circumstances.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch myfile
    chown root myfile  # Permission denied
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Changing owner is root's privilege only.

---
### **71. Can a regular user change file group?**

*   **Explanation:** In the standard configuration of most Linux distributions — **NO**. Changing a file's group using `chgrp` or `chown :group` requires the **`CAP_CHOWN`** privilege, which only the superuser (root) possesses by default. This restriction is implemented for security reasons, to prevent unauthorized changes to system file group ownership.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Try to change group as regular user
    touch myfile.txt
    groups  # Check groups we belong to
    chgrp $(id -gn) myfile.txt  # Permission denied (in standard system)

    # Check error
    echo $?  # Return code not 0 - error

    # Only root can change group
    sudo chgrp www-data myfile.txt  # Will work
    ls -l myfile.txt  # Group changed
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** In standard Linux, changing file group is an **exclusive superuser privilege**. Regular users cannot change file groups, even for files they own.

---

### **72. How do permissions work in symbolic links?**

*   **Explanation:** The permissions of the symlink itself (always `lrwxrwxrwx`) don't matter. The permissions of the TARGET file are checked.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ln -s /etc/shadow shadow_link
    ls -l shadow_link  # lrwxrwxrwx ... but:
    cat shadow_link    # Permission denied (permissions on /etc/shadow)
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Symlinks are just pointers. Permissions are checked on the target.

---

### **73. Do permissions apply to the symlink itself or the target file?**

*   **Explanation:** The TARGET file. Always.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch target.txt
    chmod 600 target.txt
    ln -s target.txt link.txt
    cat link.txt  # Permissions of target.txt are checked (600)
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Permissions are checked on the symlink's target.

---

### **74. How to change permissions on the file pointed to by a symlink?**

*   **Explanation:** The `chmod` command applied to a symlink automatically changes the permissions of the target file. The system follows the link and applies changes to the final object. The permissions of the symlink itself (always `rwxrwxrwx`) remain unchanged and do not affect the operation.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Create target file and symlink
    touch target_file.txt
    chmod 600 target_file.txt
    ln -s target_file.txt symbolic_link.txt

    # Change permissions via symlink
    chmod 644 symbolic_link.txt

    # Check result
    ls -l target_file.txt  # Permissions changed to 644
    ls -l symbolic_link.txt # Symlink permissions remained lrwxrwxrwx

    # Check access
    cat symbolic_link.txt  # Now readable by all
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** To change target file permissions, you can work with the symlink as with a direct path — the system will perform redirection.

---

### **75. Are special bits preserved on symlinks?**

*   **Explanation:** NO. You cannot set special bits on the symlink itself.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 4755 link.txt  # Meaningless
    ls -l link.txt       # Still lrwxrwxrwx
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Special bits don't work on symlinks.

---

### **76. How do permissions work in hard links?**

*   **Explanation:** A hard link is another name for the same inode. All metadata (including permissions) is SHARED.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch original.txt
    ln original.txt hardlink.txt
    chmod 755 original.txt
    ls -l hardlink.txt  # Permissions also 755!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Hard links — one file, different names. Shared permissions.

---

### **77. Do hard link and original file have different permissions?**

*   **Explanation:** NO. This is the same file.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    chmod 751 hardlink.txt
    ls -l original.txt  # Permissions also changed!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Hard link permissions = original file permissions.

---

### **78. How do permissions work in filesystems with ACL (Access Control Lists)?**

*   **Explanation:** ACL extends the basic model. You can set permissions for specific users/groups beyond standard user/group/other.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch file.txt
    setfacl -m u:username:rwx file.txt
    getfacl file.txt  # View extended permissions
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** ACL = extended permissions on top of basic ones.

---

### **79. Can octal permissions conflict with ACL?**

*   **Explanation:** YES. When changing octal permissions `chmod` can change the basic ACL entries.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    setfacl -m u:user1:rwx file.txt
    chmod 600 file.txt  # This might reset part of the ACL!
    getfacl file.txt    # Check changes
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod` affects ACL — be careful!

---

### **80. How to view basic permissions and ACL simultaneously?**

*   **Explanation:** `ls -l` shows basic permissions, `getfacl` — full picture with ACL.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    ls -l file.txt  # Basic permissions
    getfacl file.txt # Full permissions + ACL

    # If ACL exists, ls -l will show a '+' sign
    # -rw-r--r--+  # Plus = ACL exists
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `getfacl` for detailed view, `ls -l` for quick look.

---

Continuing the breakdown! The last 20 questions are advanced topics, but we'll handle them. 🔥

---

### **81. How are octal permissions displayed when extended ACL is present?**

*   **Explanation:** In `ls -l`, a `+` sign appears after the regular permissions. This indicates the file has extended ACL.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    touch acl_file.txt
    setfacl -m u:nobody:rwx acl_file.txt
    ls -l acl_file.txt  # You'll see: -rw-r--r--+
    getfacl acl_file.txt # See full ACL picture
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Plus `+` in `ls -l` = extended ACL exists.

---

### **82. Does changing octal permissions affect existing ACL?**

*   **Explanation:** YES, significantly! `chmod` overwrites the basic ACL entries (for owner, group, and mask).
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    setfacl -m u:user1:rwx file.txt
    getfacl file.txt # Remember ACL
    chmod 600 file.txt
    getfacl file.txt # Compare - basic entries changed!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod` overwrites basic ACL entries. Be careful!

---

### **83. How to completely replace ACL with octal permissions?**

*   **Explanation:** Using `chmod` resets the extended ACL to the basic model corresponding to the specified octal permissions.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    setfacl -m u:user1:rwx,u:user2:r-- file.txt
    getfacl file.txt # See extended ACL
    chmod 644 file.txt
    getfacl file.txt # Extended ACL removed, only basic permissions remain
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod` = reset ACL to basic permissions.

---

### **84. What default permissions are used in different Linux distributions?**

*   **Explanation:** Most modern Linux distributions use umask `022` by default, creating files with permissions `644` (rw-r--r--) and directories with permissions `755` (rwxr-xr-x). Some group-oriented systems may use umask `002`, creating files `664` (rw-rw-r--) and directories `775` (rwxrwxr-x). The umask value can be checked and changed.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Check current umask
    umask

    # Create test files to check default permissions
    touch test_file.txt
    mkdir test_directory
    ls -ld test_file.txt test_directory

    # Temporarily change umask (current session only)
    umask 002
    touch test_file_group.txt
    ls -l test_file_group.txt  # Permissions will be: -rw-rw-r--
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Standard umask `022` provides a balance of security and convenience. Always check umask settings in your system.

---



### **85. Are there differences in permission behavior across different filesystems (ext4, XFS, btrfs)?**

*   **Explanation:** The basic permission model (user/group/other with rwx permissions) works the same across all major Linux filesystems, as it's a kernel function. However, support for extended features may differ:
    - **ACL (Access Control Lists):** ext4, XFS, btrfs support, but may require additional mount options
    - **Extended attributes:** implementation and supported attributes may vary
    - **Journaling:** doesn't affect permission semantics, but ensures metadata integrity

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Determine filesystem type
    df -T /
    lsblk -f

    # Check ACL support for ext4
    tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep "Default mount options"

    # For XFS check capabilities
    xfs_info /mount/point 2>/dev/null || echo "XFS tools not installed"
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Basic permissions work identically, but extended features (ACL, attributes) require checking support in the specific filesystem.


---

### **86. How do permissions work in network filesystems (NFS)?**

*   **Explanation:** NFS transmits UID/GID between client and server. UID/GID matching of users is critical!
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # On client:
    showmount -e nfs_server
    # Problem: if on client user1 has UID 1000, and on server UID 1000 is user2,
    # then user1 will get user2's permissions on files!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** NFS works with UID/GID, not names. Their correspondence is important.

---

### **87. Are octal permissions preserved when copying files between different OS?**

*   **Explanation:** Depends on the destination FS:
    - **FAT32/NTFS (without settings):** permissions lost
    - **ext4 on Linux:** preserved
    - **scp/rsync between Linux:** preserved with options
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Preserving permissions when copying between systems:
    scp -p file.txt user@remote:/path/  # -p preserves attributes
    rsync -a source/ user@remote:/dest/ # -a preserves everything
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** When copying to unsupported FS, permissions are lost.

---

### **88. How are permissions handled during archiving and extraction?**

*   **Explanation:** Depends on the program and options. `tar` by default preserves permissions inside the archive.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Create file with special permissions:
    touch secret.txt
    chmod 600 secret.txt

    # Archive:
    tar -cf archive.tar secret.txt

    # Extract:
    tar -xf archive.tar
    ls -l secret.txt  # Permissions preserved!
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `tar` preserves permissions inside archive.

---

### **89. Are special bits preserved in tar archives?**

*   **Explanation:** Yes, the `tar` utility by default preserves special bits (setuid, setgid, sticky bit) when creating an archive. However, the ability to restore these bits upon extraction depends on the permissions of the user performing the extraction - setting setuid/setgid usually requires root privileges.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Create file with special bits
    touch test_script.sh
    chmod 4755 test_script.sh  # setuid
    ls -l test_script.sh

    # Archive
    tar -cf archive_with_special.tar test_script.sh

    # Extract (check bit preservation)
    tar -xf archive_with_special.tar
    ls -l test_script.sh  # setuid should be preserved

    # Explicit permission preservation when creating archive
    tar --preserve-permissions -cf secure_archive.tar important_files/
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** `tar` preserves special bits in the archive, but restoring them upon extraction may require elevated privileges.

---
### **90. What tar options preserve permissions?**

*   **Explanation:** For guaranteed preservation of permissions and metadata, the following options are used:
    - `-p` or `--preserve-permissions` or `--same-permissions` - preserves permissions
    - `--same-owner` - preserves owner and group (requires root)
    - `-a` or `--auto-compress` - automatic compression, NOT related to permission preservation

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Correct archive creation with permission preservation
    tar -cpf archive.tar /path/to/files/

    # Alternative syntax
    tar --create --preserve-permissions --file=archive.tar /path/to/files/

    # Complete preservation of all attributes (requires root)
    sudo tar --preserve-permissions --same-owner -cf full_backup.tar /etc/

    # Extraction with permission preservation
    tar -xpf archive.tar
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Use `-p` to preserve permissions and `--same-owner` to preserve owner. Always check command syntax.

---


### **91. How to restore permissions when extracting an archive?**

*   **Explanation:** To restore original permissions, use the `-p` option during extraction. If permissions were lost or you need to set specific permissions, you can use a combination of `tar` and `chmod`.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Extraction with original permission preservation
    tar -xpf archive.tar

    # If you need to set safe default permissions
    tar -tf archive.tar | while read file; do
        if [ -f "$file" ]; then
            chmod 644 "$file"  # Files - read for all
        elif [ -d "$file" ]; then
            chmod 755 "$file"  # Directories - read and execute for all
        fi
    done

    # Restoring permissions for web server (example)
    find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
    find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Use `tar -xpf` to preserve original permissions. For mass permission correction, use `find` with `chmod`.
---


### **92. How do permissions work in Docker containers?**

*   **Explanation:** Inside the container, the standard Linux permission model is used. The main problem arises when mounting volumes from the host - the UID/GID of files on the host must match the UID/GID of users inside the container.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Problem: UID mismatch
    # On host: file belongs to UID 1000 (user1)
    # In container: UID 1000 might be a different user

    # Solution 1: change owner on host
    chown 33:33 /host/path  # www-data usually has UID 33

    # Solution 2: run container with specific UID
    docker run -u 1000:1000 -v /host/path:/container/path image_name

    # Solution 3: use user namespaces
    docker run --userns=host -v /host/path:/container/path image_name

    # Check UID inside container
    docker exec container_name id
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Watch for UID/GID correspondence between host and container when working with mounted volumes.

---

### **93. Are permissions preserved when mounting volumes in Docker?**

*   **Explanation:** YES, permissions are preserved, as the volume is mounted directly. Problems due to UID/GID mismatch.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # File on host: user1 (UID 1000):user1 (GID 1000)
    # In container UID 1000 = user2, GID 1000 = group2
    # File in container will appear as user2:group2
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Permissions preserved, but owner is "translated" via UID/GID.

---

### **94. How do permissions work in virtual machines?**

*   **Explanation:** Similar to physical machines on virtual disks. In shared folders — like in network FS.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # In VM with VirtualBox Shared Folders:
    # Files may have fixed permissions or lose them
    mount | grep vboxsf  # look for shared folders
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** On virtual disks — normal, in shared folders — may have problems.

---

### **95. How do permissions work in chroot environments?**

*   **Explanation:** Completely analogous to a regular system. `chroot` only changes the root directory for the process.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # In chroot environment:
    chroot /path/to/chroot /bin/bash
    ls -l /  # You see chroot environment files with their permissions
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** In chroot, permissions work standardly inside the new "root".

---

### **96. Are there differences in permission behavior across different Linux kernel versions?**

*   **Explanation:** The basic model has been unchanged for decades. Implementation details and extended feature support change.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Check kernel version:
    uname -r
    # New kernels may better support ACL in certain FS
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** Basic permissions same, extended capabilities improve.

---

### **97. How do permissions work in LXC/LXD containers?**

*   **Explanation:** Similar to Docker and chroot. Containers use kernel isolation mechanisms, but inside — standard filesystem.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    lxc exec container-name -- ls -l /
    # You'll see standard file permissions inside container
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** In LXC/LXD, permissions work like in a regular system.

---

### **98. How do permissions work in the systemd init system?**

*   **Explanation:** systemd and its services obey the same rules. It's important to configure user/group in unit files.
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # View unit file:
    systemctl cat nginx
    # Look for User= and Group= lines
    # Service will run with specified user's permissions
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** systemd launches services as specified users with their permissions.

---


### **99. How do permissions affect daemons and services operation?**

*   **Explanation:** Permissions are critically important for system services operation. Each service runs as a specific user and can only access resources that this user has permissions to. Incorrect permissions are a common cause of "Permission denied" errors.

*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Determine service user
    ps aux | grep nginx
    # or
    systemctl show nginx --property=User,Group

    # Check permissions on configuration files
    ls -l /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ls -l /var/www/html/

    # Example permission setup for web server
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
    find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
    find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

    # Check logs for permission errors
    journalctl -u nginx -f
    tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
    ```

*   **Conclusion:** Always check which user a service runs as and configure file permissions accordingly. Monitor system logs to detect permission issues.

---

### **100. What system calls are used to change permissions?**

*   **Explanation:**
    - `chmod()` — change permissions
    - `chown()` — change owner and group
    - `fchmodat()`, `fchownat()` — modern versions
*   **Practice:**
    ```bash
    # Utilities use these system calls:
    strace chmod 755 file.txt 2>&1 | grep chmod
    # You'll see chmod() or fchmodat() call
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** `chmod()`, `chown()` — low-level system calls for working with permissions.
